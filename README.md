# Learning C++
Welcome to "Learning C++" Repository.

This repository is used to register my studies in C++ focused on scientific programming. My main source is the book "C++ for mathematicians". Here you can access my solutions for the exercises in this book and for the problem of "Project Euler". You can use any code posted here that you believe it is useful. My goal is to update this repository with more material and not restricted to the codes the book or Project Euler.


## Here you can find:

* [Book's exercises](/C++_for_mathematicians_book/README.md)
* [Project Euler](/Project_Euler/README.md)
