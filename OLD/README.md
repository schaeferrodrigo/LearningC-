# LearningC++


Compile C++ code in Linux:

To compile the program, go to the directory where you have saved the cpp file and use the command in the following format:

g++ -o swap swap.cpp

Basically, with -o option, your are telling the compiler to generate the executable code in file swap. If you don’t do that, it will be defaulted to a.out file which is not a good programming practice.
Run C++ code in Linux:

Once you have compiled the code, you’ll get the executable file. You just need to run it in the following manner:

./swap

This will run your code.
